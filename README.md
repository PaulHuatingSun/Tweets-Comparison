### Introduction:  Chosen Locations and Time
A Twitter crawler is created to collect geotagged tweets. Below is the explanation of why the time periods and locations are chosen to compare.

The time period chosen for this analysis is about 9:00 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time which is equivalent to 5:00 p.m. British Summer Time. This time period is selected because this is a time period when Twitter users are more likely to be active in the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Republic of Ireland. 

The locations chosen for this comparison are the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Republic of Ireland. This is because the United States has the highest amount of Twitter users among all countries, and the United Kingdom has the highest amount of Twitter users in Europe. The Republic of Ireland is included because it would be interesting to see within Ireland how Northern Ireland (which belongs to the United Kingdom) and the Republic of Ireland (Southern Ireland) have different numbers of tweets posted. 

After choosing the time period and locations, the geotagged tweet data over a period of 180 seconds was collected to analyze. This analysis aims to find the similarities and differences in the number and distribution of the tweets posted in the three questions. Specifically, this analysis intends to answer these questions:
* Where are the majority of the posted tweets located in the countries?
* How does the number of tweets differ in these countries during the chosen time period?
* Within Ireland, how does the number of tweets differ between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland?
* What are the most common words used in these tweets, and how may they have different meanings based on the location of the tweets?


### Visualizing Geo-Tagged Data
##### Locations of the posted tweets in the United States
![Map 1](/image/U.S._Tweets.png "Map 1") 
This map shows tweets posted on April 19th at around 9:00 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time in the United States. A large number of tweets were posted in the United States during this time. From the map, it is observed that most tweets posted were located on the east and west coasts of the United States. The number of tweets posted is significantly less in the middle part of the United States. Specifically, many of the tweets clustered in cities like New York City, Washington, D.C., Miami, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. This makes sense as these cities are popular and have high population densities. Also, in Washington, D.C., many people will likely post their political opinion on Twitter on a daily basis since many officials are in Washington, D.C.

##### Locations of the posted tweets in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland
![Map 2](/image/U.K._Ireland.png "Map 2") 
This map shows tweets posted on April 19th at around 5:00 p.m. British Summer Time in the United Kingdom and Ireland. A large number of tweets were posted in the United Kingdom during this time. Ireland has a lot less number of tweets posted during this time. From the map, it is observed that most tweets in the United Kingdom are located in major cities like London, Liverpool, and Manchester. In the Republic of Ireland, most tweets posted are located in the capital, Dublin. It is interesting to see that even within Ireland, Northern Ireland, which belongs to the United Kingdom, has almost the same number of tweets posted as the Republic of Ireland.
##### Conclusion
Compared to the United Kindom and the Republic of Ireland, the United States has a relatively higher number of tweets posted on April 19th at around 10 a.m. This may indicate that there are more Twitter users in the United States than in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Similarly, all three countries have their tweets located in their major cities, such as Washington, D.C., London, and Dublin. These maps provide information that is helpful in order to understand where and when the users are most active in certain countries.

### Word Cloud Analysis
##### Word Cloud for United States
![Word Art 1](/image/Wordcloud-US.png "Word Art 1") 
Some common words on April 19th at around 9:00 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time in the United States were "Job," "Go," "Up," "Out," and "Now." Based on the time, it makes sense that many words are related to work since it is early in the morning. 
##### Word Cloud for United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland
![Word Art 2](/image/Wordcloud-UK_Ireland.png "Word Art 2") 
Some common words on April 19th at around 5:00 p.m. British Summer Time in the United Kingdom and Ireland were "Go," "Love," "Out," "Today," and "Done." This also makes sense since the time is 5:00 p.m. in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. People were most likely done with work and about to go home.
##### Conclusion
Overall, these word clouds share words such as "Go," "Out," and "Up." However, because of different times, these words represent different meanings. In the United States, these words were most likely related to going to work. These words were most likely associated with people out of work in the other region (The U.K. and the Republic of Ireland). This shows how the exact words can have different meanings based on the location of these tweets.
